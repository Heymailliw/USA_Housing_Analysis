Project Description:

The project "USA Housing Data Analysis" explores a dataset containing information about housing prices, size, location, and other relevant features across various cities in the United States. The dataset is sourced from publicly available real estate data and is analyzed using several data analysis and visualization techniques.

Project Steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

The dataset is loaded into RapidMiner, where it undergoes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and feature engineering.
Data Analysis Tasks:

Linear Regression: Predicting housing prices based on different features such as size, number of bedrooms, etc.

Confusion Matrix: Evaluating the performance of a classification model.

KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors): Identifying similar houses based on features.

K-Means Clustering: Grouping houses into clusters based on similarity.

Visualization and Interpretation:

Visualizations are generated to understand the distribution of housing prices, relationships between variables, and cluster groupings.
Interpretation of the results obtained from each analysis task is provided to derive actionable insights.
